# Use Case - Taxi Cancellations 
## BUSINESS SITUATION
In late 2013, the taxi company Yourcabs.com in Bangalore, India was facing a problem with the drivers using their platformâ€”not all drivers were showing up for their scheduled calls. Drivers would cancel their acceptance of a call, and, if the cancellation did not occur with adequate notice, the customer would be delayed or even left high and dry.  
  
Bangalore is a key tech center in India, and technology was transforming the taxi industry. Yourcabs.com featured an online booking system (though customers could phone in as well), and presented itself as a taxi booking portal. The Uber ride sharing service started its Bangalore operations in mid-2014.  
  
Yourcabs.com had collected data on its bookings from 2011 to 2013, and posted a contest on Kaggle, in coordination with the Indian School of Business, to see what it could learn about the problem of cab cancellations.   
  
The data presented for this case are a randomly selected subset of the original data, with 10,000 rows, one row for each booking. There are 17 input variables, including user (customer) ID, vehicle model, whether the booking was made online or via a mobile app, type of travel, type of booking package, geographic information, and the date and time of the scheduled trip. The target variable of interest is the binary indicator of whether a ride was canceled. The overall cancellation rate is between 7% and 8%.   

### The following is a direction and code flow for the task by Yourcabs.com: 
1. How can a predictive model based on these data be used by Yourcabs.com?
